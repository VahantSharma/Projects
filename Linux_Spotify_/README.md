# Spotify Installer Script

Welcome to the Spotify Installer Script! ðŸŽ¶ This handy Bash script helps you install the Spotify client on your Debian-based system with ease.

## Overview

This script performs the following tasks:

1. Checks if the script is being run as the root user.
2. Verifies that the `apt-get` package manager is available.
3. Searches for the Spotify repository in your systemâ€™s sources list.
4. Prompts the user to add the Spotify repository if itâ€™s not found.
5. Updates the package list and installs the Spotify client.
6. Displays a fun congratulatory message upon successful installation.

## Requirements

- A Debian-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu).
- Root privileges to install software.

## How to Use

1. **Open Terminal**: Launch your terminal application.
2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   If you havenâ€™t already, make the script executable by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x spotify_installer.sh
3. **Run the Script: Execute the script with root privileges**:
    sudo ./spotify_installer.sh
4. **Follow the Prompts: The script will guide you through the installation process. If the Spotify repository is not found, it will ask if youâ€™d like to add it.**\

# Important Notes

- **Running as Root**:
    - Ensure you run the script as a root user.
    - If you try to run it as a regular user, youâ€™ll receive a message indicating that administrator privileges are required.
- **Repository Check**:
    - The script checks if the Spotify repository is already added.
    - If not, it will prompt you for confirmation to add it.
- **Installation Time**:
    - The script will pause for 10 seconds after installation to let you enjoy a quirky little poem.
